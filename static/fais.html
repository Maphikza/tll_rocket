                                        that could
                                        affect their compliance with the requirements for being "fit and proper", the
                                        registrar must approve
                                        the key individual as compliant with the requirements before they may take part

                                        the registrar must notify the applicant and provide reasons for the refusal.<br>
                                        A person who has been accredited by the Medical Schemes Act must be granted
                                        authority to render the
                                        specific financial service for which they were accredited, and will be issued a
                                        license, subject to the registrar being satisfied that the person and their key
                                        individual(s) meet the
                                        requirements for being "fit and proper" persons.<br> The registrar may at any
                                        time
                                        withdraw or amend any condition or restriction on a license, after considering
                                        submissions from the
                                        licensee, if the registrar is satisfied that doing so is justified and will not
                                        harm
                                        the interests of the licensee's clients. A licensee must display a copy of their
                                        license at every
                                        business premises and ensure that references to being a licensed financial

                                        licensee must also be able to produce their license upon request. No person may
                                        use a license that
                                        has lapsed, been withdrawn, or is under suspension, or falsely claim to be
                                        authorized to render
                                        financial services.<br> No person may perform any act, make or publish any
                                        statement, advertisement,
                                        brochure, or similar communication that relates to rendering a financial

                                        is misleading, false, deceptive, contrary to the public interest, or contains an
                                        incorrect statement
                                        of fact.<br> If a provider is a corporate or unincorporated body, trust, or
                                        partnership,
                                        the provider must ensure that every director, member, trustee, or partner who is
                                        not a key individual
                                        in the provider's business meets the requirements for being a "fit and proper"
                                        person.<br>
                                        The provider must also inform the registrar within 15 days of appointing a new
                                        director, member,
                                        trustee, or partner. If the registrar is satisfied that a director, member,
                                        trustee, or partner
                                        does not meet the requirements for being "fit and proper", the registrar may
                                        suspend or withdraw the

                                        must give, and does not do so within the specified period or
                                        any extension of that period, then that person will have to pay a penalty. The
                                        amount of the penalty
                                        will be up to R1 000, or any greater amount that is prescribed,
                                        for each day that the failure continues. The registrar can waive the penalty, or
                                        part of it, if there
                                        is a good reason. The registrar must give the person a notice
                                        saying that they are imposing the penalty, and this notice must say when the
                                        penalty will take effect.
                                        The registrar must also give the person a reasonable opportunity to
                                        say why they should not have to pay the penalty.<br>

                                        will also have to pay
                                        interest on the amount they owe. The rate of interest and the
                                        way it is calculated will be determined by the Minister from time to time. The
                                        fees, penalty, and
                                        interest owed are considered to be debts that the Board is owed, and
                                        the Board can take the person to court to get the money.</p>
