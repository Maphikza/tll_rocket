                        away.

                        manner, and timeframes determined by the supervisory body. The supervisory body

                        given by the supervisory body to include conditions of compliance with the law
                        and the availability of resources to ensure compliance. Furthermore, the

                    the provisions of this Act apply, is conducted.<br>

                    (f) against the issue of a receipt, seize any document obtained in
                    terms of paragraphs (c) to (e). which in the opinion of the inspector
                    may constitute evidence of non-compliance with a provision of this
                    Act or any order, determination or directive made in terms of this
                    Act.<br>

                    (iii) when required to do so by a court; or<br>

                    institution regulated or supervised by a supervisory body in terms of this
                    Act or any other law, conduct an inspection only if a supervisory body

                        to whom the provisions of this Act apply, is conducted, in order to determine
                        compliance with this Act. The inspector may question any person on the premises,
                        order any person who has or had any relevant documents in their possession or

                    with any law;<br>
                    (c) any remedial steps taken by the institution or person to prevent a
                    recurrence of the non-compliance;<br>
                    (d) any steps taken or to be taken against the institution or person

                    (e) any other relevant factor, including mitigating factors.<br>
                    (3) The Centre or supervisory body may impose any one or more of the
                    following administrative sanctions:<br>
                    (a) A caution not to repeat the conduct which led to the non-

                    (b) a reprimand;<br>
                    (c) a directive to take remedial action or to make specific
                    arrangements;<br>
                    (d) the restriction or suspension of certain specified business activities;<br>

                    persons and R50 million in respect of any legal person.<br>
                    (4) The Centre or supervisory body may—<br>
                    (a) in addition to the imposition of an administrative sanction, make
                    recommendations to the relevant institution or person in respect of

                    made in terms of this Act;<br>
                    (b) direct that a financial penalty must be paid by a natural person or
                    persons for whose actions the relevant institution is accountable in
                    law, if that person or persons was or were personally responsible
                    for the non-compliance;<br>
                    (c) suspend any part of an administrative sanction on any condition
                    the Centre or the supervisory body deems appropriate for a period
                    not exceeding five years.<br>
                    (5) Before imposing an administrative sanction, the Centre or supervisory
                    body must give the institution or person reasonable notice in writing—
                    (a) of the nature of the alleged non-compliance:<br>
                    (b) of the intention to impose an administrative sanction;<br>
                    (c) of the amount or particulars of the intended administrative
                    sanction; and<br>
                    (d) that the institution or person may, in writing, within a period
                    specified in the notice, make representations as to why the
                    administrative sanction should not be imposed.<br>
                    (6)(a) After considering any representations and the factors referred to in
                    subsection (2), the Centre, subject to paragraph (c). or supervisory body
                    may impose an administrative sanction the Centre or supervisory body
                    considers appropriate.<br>
                    (b) Upon imposing the administrative sanction the Centre or supervisory body
                    must, in writing, notify the institution or person—<br>
                    (i) of the decision and the reasons therefore; and<br>
                    (ii) of the right to appeal against the decision in accordance with
                    section 45D.<br>
                    (c) The Centre must, prior to taking a decision contemplated in paragraph (a),
                    consult the relevant supervisory body, if applicable.<br>
                    (7)(a) Any financial penalty imposed must be paid into the Criminal Assets
                    Recovery Account established by section 63 of the Prevention Act within
                    the period and in the manner as may be specified in the relevant notice.<br>
                    (b) If the institution or person fails to pay the financial penalty within the
                    specified period and an appeal has not been lodged within the required
                    period, the Centre or supervisory body may forthwith file with the clerk or
                    registrar of a competent court a certified copy of the notice contemplated
                    in subsection (6)(b), and the notice thereupon has the effect of a civil
                    judgment lawfully given in that court in favour of the Centre or supervisory
                    body.<br>
                    (8) An administrative sanction contemplated in this section may not be
                    imposed if the respondent has been charged with a criminal offence in
                    respect of the same set of facts.<br>
                    (9) If a court assesses the penalty to be imposed on a person convicted of an
                    offence in terms of this Act, the court must take into account any
                    administrative sanction imposed under this section in respect of the same
                    set of facts.<br>
                    (10) An administrative sanction imposed in terms of this Act does not constitute
                    a previous conviction as contemplated in Chapter 27 of the Criminal
                    Procedure Act. 1977 (Act No. 51 of 1977).<br>
                    (11) Unless the Director or supervisory body is of the opinion that there are
                    exceptional circumstances present that justify the preservation of the
                    confidentiality of a decision the Director or supervisory body must make
                    public the decision and the nature of any sanction imposed if—<br>
                    (a) an institution or person does not appeal against a decision of the
                    Centre or supervisory body within the required period; or<br>
                    (b) the appeal board confirms the decision of the Centre or
                    supervisory body.</p>

                    such a person shall be entitled to legal representation at his or her

                    (a) confirm, set aside or vary the relevant decision of the Centre or

                    (b) refer a matter back for consideration or reconsideration by the
                    Centre or the supervisory body concerned in accordance with the
                    directions of the appeal board.<br>
                    (8) The decision of a majority of the members of the appeal board shall be the
                    decision of that board.<br>

                        years and may be reappointed. An alternate acts as a member when a member is

                        pending.

                    (b) the applicant had an interest in the cash or bearer negotiable
                    instrument or property in question at the time of the forfeiture, the court
                    must direct that the applicant be compensated by the State in an

                    court making the determination, and such appeal may be heard either

                    fit.<br>

                        search your belongings or container if they have reasonable grounds to believe
                        that an offence has been, or is about to be committed. They can also seize any
                        cash or bearer negotiable instrument that they find. Anything that is seized
                        must be returned as soon as possible, unless the person has been arrested or a
                        summons has been issued, in which case it can be kept for 90 days. If the person
                        is acquitted or there is no forfeiture order, the belongings must be returned.If
                        someone is convicted of an offence, the court can declare any cash or property
                        that was seized, or is in the possession of the convicted person, to be
                        forfeited to the state. This doesn't affect any interest that other people may
                        have in the cash or property, as long as they can prove that they acquired the
                        interest in good faith and didn't know that the cash or property was going to be
                        used for the offence.If you are unhappy with a decision made by the court under
                        section 8, you can appeal against the decision as if it were a conviction by the
                        court. This means that you can either have the appeal heard separately or at the
                        same time as an appeal against the conviction that led to the declaration of
                        forfeiture, or against the sentence imposed for that conviction. To make a
                        declaration of forfeiture or to decide any interest under section 8, the court
                        may refer to the evidence and proceedings from the trial or hear new evidence as
                        it sees fit.
